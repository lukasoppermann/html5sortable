# Contributing

We ♥︎ contributions, so if you find a bug or have a great idea create an [issue](https://github.com/lukasoppermann/html5sortable/issues) or even better, send a [pull request](https://github.com/lukasoppermann/html5sortable/pulls). We are a beginners friendly project, so if you are not 100% sure how to make your PR fullfill all the points below, just start with what you know and send a PR mentioning the points you need help with.


## Pull Requests

- We use [standardjs](https://standardjs.com/) to enforce a good coding style, so please write your code according to it. (Run `npm test` to where you need to do some tweaking.)

- **Add tests!** - To avoid bugs we keep the test coverage as high as possible. Please help by adding tests to your bugfixes & features.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **One pull request per feature** - We appreciate every improvement you have for the project. To make it easy and fast to merge your pull requests, only change one thing per PR. We rather have 10 small PRs than one giant one.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.

**Remember:** If you have trouble with any of the steps above, don't despair, just ask for help.


## Running Tests

``` bash
$ npm test
```


**Happy coding!**
